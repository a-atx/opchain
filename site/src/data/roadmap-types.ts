/**
 * Types + loader for the build-time roadmap pull
 * (`scripts/gen-roadmap.mjs` → `site/src/data/roadmap.json`).
 *
 * Source: GitHub Issues on the public `asfbay-bit/opchain-skills` mirror,
 * filtered to the four `roadmap:*` labels (that label IS the bucket — no
 * separate visibility gate, unlike the old Linear `roadmap-visible` +
 * state-driven-bucket model). See docs/plans/2026-08-26-roadmap-github-issues.md.
 *
 * The JSON is gitignored. `npm run gen-roadmap` regenerates it; `loadRoadmap()`
 * falls back to an empty shape if the file isn't there — so type-check
 * passes regardless of whether the JSON exists at the moment.
 *
 * Loaded via `import.meta.glob` rather than `fs.readFileSync(__dirname + ...)`
 * on purpose: Astro/Vite bundles this module into a prerender chunk whose
 * runtime location is NOT `site/src/data` (it's somewhere under
 * `dist/.prerender/chunks/`), so an `import.meta.url`-relative fs read
 * silently fails during `astro build` even though it works fine under plain
 * `node`/Vitest. `import.meta.glob` is resolved against the *source* module
 * graph at compile time, so it isn't affected by where the compiled chunk
 * ends up — and, same as the fs approach, a missing file just yields no
 * match (not a hard import error), preserving the "safe to build before
 * `npm run gen-roadmap` has run" contract.
